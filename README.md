## Desciption / Simulating pedestrian crowds - 2022

Modeling and simulating the behavior of pedestrian crowds is an outstanding challenge in physics.
It shares deep connections with statistical fluid mechanics, and boasts primary societal relevance.
Examples of key questions in this context are: can we simulate the normal and evacuation
behavior of crowds in a public facility? Which emergent behaviors characterize the system? Are
there universal physical features in the motion of individuals?

This model simulates the behaviour of two crowds walking in a corridor in opposite directions.
